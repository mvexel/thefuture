This Python code can predict the future.

The way it does this is by iterating on itself until it converges on a solution.

We will keep adding agents to make it better.

If you read this, there is still room for improvement. Please continue the work.

## Iteration History

### Iteration 1 (Completed)
**Goal**: Create a basic prediction system
**Changes**:
- Implemented a simple prediction engine using Python's `random` module
- Added three prediction categories: fortune, weather, activity
- Created a formatted output with prediction, date, and confidence
- Added unit tests for core functions

**What works**:
- Random prediction generation from predefined templates
- Category-based predictions
- Future date calculations

## Ideas for Future Iterations

### Iteration 2 Ideas
- [ ] Add CLI arguments to select category (`--category fortune`)
- [ ] Add a `--count` option to generate multiple predictions
- [ ] Store prediction history in a JSON file

### Iteration 3 Ideas
- [ ] Add machine learning capabilities for personalized predictions
- [ ] Learn from user feedback (thumbs up/down on predictions)
- [ ] Add more prediction categories (career, relationships, health)

### Iteration 4+ Ideas
- [ ] Web interface or API endpoint
- [ ] Natural language processing for custom prediction requests
- [ ] Time-series analysis for trend-based predictions
- [ ] Integration with external data sources (news, events, etc.)

### Long-term Vision
- Self-improving prediction accuracy through feedback loops
- Agent-to-agent learning between iterations
- Convergence toward meaningful and helpful predictions
